30-50 Feral Hogs was made during the craze of hog based memes in August of 2019. It's not my best work, but due to the explosive popularity of the meme, it continues to be my most popular game.

The entire game was made in about 8 hours, with maybe half of that being bug fixing because I was still rather new to Unity at that time. (And out of practice.)
