# The Team
Gourd Getaway was created for the 2020 Jam-O-Lantern. Unlike most other game jams, Jam-O-Lantern had an abudence of composers and sound designers. The game had 3 composers and me. The composers did a really good job working on each of their peices, while I made the game for the songs to go in. 

# My Role
I was the lead dveloper on this project. Taking care of all parts of the games development beyond the sound and a the candy models. Most of my time spend on the project was spent level designing (8 levels in total.) Of course, programming was also a large degree of work, but I kept the code scope down to make sure the desgin had the focus. The other major part of the work was in animation. There's two custom cutscenes in the game which I managed the animation on along with the models used in the animations.

# Process
The game took a week to make.


# What I've Learned
There were two major things that I learned in making this project.

### 3rd Person Camera

### Wwise
