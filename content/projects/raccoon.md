# The Team

On Raccoon Revenge there we're 6 total team memebers. Focuses within the team include an artist, UI designer, two programmers, and a producer.

# My Role

With such a talented team, I knew from the start that I would have to find the gaps that I could fill. A pivotal moment in establishing myself in the team was when I voulenteered to go to a talk on the companies build process. This lead to me being the build manager for the game, which is a role I took twice a week on our designated build days. It was not the role I wanted going into the project, but I actually had a lot of fun writing the game's copy and build notes, although it was still painful when builds wouldn't work. 

On the non-build days I acted as a programmer for the team. 

# Process

# What I've Learned

A whole lot.
