Hi! I'm Elijah Cobb: a game developer and game designer.

I'm most comfortable when I get to fill the gaps in a game development team, from any angle that I'm needed. Level Design is my foundation, but from their I've learned and become a proficient programmer, 3D modeller, texture artist (I always look for excuses to use Substance Designer) and game producer. I love the process of making games and other playful experiences, and that drives me to make the best games I can.

You can find me at Boston area game jams, and making observations about the Olympics on twitter.
